# a game of connect 4

  # spec
  # game grid is 6 row x 7 col, zero-based indices
  # players alternate 'dropping' discs on any none-full col, player 1 first
  # play is handled by a 'play' method
  # successful move returns "Player n has a turn!"
  # cols fill up as discs dropped
  # attempt on full col returns "Column full!"
  # four discs in horizontal or diagonal row is win condition, returns
  # "Player n wins!"
  # moves attempted after game won return "Game has finished!"
